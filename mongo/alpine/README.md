A custom Docker image based on Alpine for MongoDB.  
Thanks to [sgerrand](https://github.com/sgerrand) and [sevmonster](https://github.com/sevmonster) for providing the glibc package for Alpine, without which this image wouldn't have been possible.  
The backed-up glibc-related packages are from the [Alpine source](https://storage.sev.monster/alpine/edge/testing) provided by sevmonster. Thanks again!
